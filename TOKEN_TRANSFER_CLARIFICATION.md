# Token Transfer Clarification

## There are TWO different token operations:

### 1. üéÅ **Demo Tokens (Minting)**
- **Purpose**: Add test tokens to your wallet for testing
- **Amount**: Now changed to 0.01 CHAT (was 100 CHAT)
- **Button**: "Get 0.01 Demo Tokens"
- **Transaction**: Calls `mintDemoTokens(0.01)`
- **Cost**: FREE (minting new tokens)

### 2. üí∏ **Message Payment (Transfer)**
- **Purpose**: Pay to send a message to NFT chatbot
- **Amount**: 0.001 CHAT tokens
- **Button**: "Send" (when typing a message)
- **Transaction**: Calls `directTokenTransfer()`
- **Cost**: 0.001 CHAT + gas fees

## Which transaction were you referring to?

### If the **Demo Tokens** were giving you 100 instead of 0.01:
- ‚úÖ **FIXED**: Now gives 0.01 CHAT tokens
- This is the "Get Demo Tokens" button

### If the **Message Payment** is charging 100 instead of 0.001:
- üîç **Need to investigate**: The payment should only be 0.001 CHAT
- Check the browser console for "DIRECT TRANSFER" logs
- The transaction data you showed seemed to be the old `processMessage()` call

## How to test the fix:

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Try the demo button**: Should now give 0.01 CHAT
3. **Try sending a message**: Should cost 0.001 CHAT
4. **Check console logs**: Look for "FIXED VERSION" and "DIRECT TRANSFER" messages

## Expected console output when sending a message:
```
üîß FIXED VERSION: Processing payment for chatbot [ID] using direct transfer method ONLY
üí∞ DIRECT TRANSFER: Exact amount being transferred: 0.001 CHAT
üöÄ DIRECT TRANSFER: About to transfer 0.001 CHAT
‚úÖ DIRECT TRANSFER: Payment of 0.001 CHAT transferred to platform
```

**Please clarify which operation was transferring 100 tokens so I can fix the right one!**
